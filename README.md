# PepBandPDF converter

## Requirements

- Musescore
- ImageMagick
- Ghostscript (Possibly on windows)

## Usage
> pepbandpdf.bat [file] [output] [size]

pepbandpdf takes a input file as a .mscx file with parts unformatted but created, and outputs pdfs in the output folder formatted for the UCSD pep band.  
size is an optional parameter which controls spacing between lines of music. A higher value means more space between lines, the default value is 1.15

## EXPERIMENTAL
This Windows version is entirely untested, written by someone who has never written a bat program and cannot run a bat script themselves.
Use it at your own risk.  

You will definitely need MuseScore3.exe to be in your %PATH%
